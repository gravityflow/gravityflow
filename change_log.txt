- Added approval step setting for notification on revert (only displays when revert setting for user input step is selected).
- Added filter gravityflow_user_input_notification_send_on_revert to confirm whether the user input step assignee notification should be prevented from sending when approval step revert notification exists (default false).
- Added the step merge tag attribute to allow merge tags to specify the step for which tokens must be generated. This allows feed add-ons to specify the step. For example, a Twilio or Slack message can contain a one-click approval link for the next step.
- Updated the processing of the workflow to trigger before the confirmation is processed.
- Fixed an edge case where the assignee attribute will remove the assignee added in the constructor and override the assignee in subsequent instances of the merge tag.
- Fixed an issue with the integrations with the Twilio Add-On where URLs get encoded breaking workflow links.
