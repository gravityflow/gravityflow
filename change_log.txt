- Fixed an issue on the User Registration Step, where manual User Activation feed setting was sending email with activation link to User.
- Fixed an issue on the User and Multi-User field 'Users Role Filter' setting display (but not filter save).
- Fixed an issue on front-end pages with WordPress 5.5 removing the page parameter.
